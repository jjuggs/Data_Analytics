# Asking the right questions
The problem statement for this portfolio is; Should people invest in the New York Stock Exchange?

# Preparation of data
The data collected for this analysis was from the New York Stock Exchange over the course of 25 years from 1980 to 2005. 

# Processing of data (Cleaning and normalising)
The data procured was in the CSV file format. Using Python, a code was written to extract the files and import them into the SQLite3 database for quick access. Through the importation, the CSV file was cleaned by ensuring no NULL in the date column and formating both columns to text and integer values.

After the imporation of the file, the database was uploaded into the data visualisation Tableau to be further normalised. This was because the data was presented in the daily baisis. To further normalise the datapoints, it was decided that the data should reflect the average of every month from 1980 to 2005.

# Analyzing the data
Through the analysis of the data from Tableau, we can conclude that people should invest in the New York Stock Exchange for the long run. There was a dip in the index from September 2000 until March 2003, after doing some research, it was found out that this was due to the 'Internet Bubble Bursting'.

# Storytelling of the data
Should people invest in the New York Stock Exchange? The short answer, yes!

Over the course of 25 years starting from 1980, there has been steady growth of the stock exchange with new high peaks being realised every so often. This is strong evidence that people should invest in the New York Stock Exchange due to the historical data presented that even if there was a dip in the stock market, it was bound to continue with an upward growth trend.

There was a large dip in the New York Stock Exchange index from September 2000 until March 2003 due to the 'Internet Bubble Bursting' that happened. In the previous decade, stocks had become overvalued and created a bullish market which crashed. This left many stocks to lose value over this time period while the market underwent correction. However, as seen in the visualisation, post March 2003, the index rose again to greater peaks and overcame the highs set in 2000.

What this shows is that for investors, staying long in the market will ultimately give them growth in the stock portfolio and to ride out the bearish markets if they are able to. From the historical data, it showed that the market tends to recover and overcome previous set peaks to show even more growth.
